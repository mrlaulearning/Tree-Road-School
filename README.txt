A tour of the program is given here: https://youtu.be/MZxOtQWuXgk

This project requires EasyGui, to install it, please visit: https://sourceforge.net/projects/easygui/files/0.97/


TLDR:A program that uses intermediate skills in Python (file writing, functions with parameter passing, lists and 2D lists) to solve a programming brief set by OCR. The program is further developed to include a simple GUI using EasyGui and TKinter. I'd be delighted to see other versions using AppJar, PyQT, wxPython or GuiZero.
